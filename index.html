      <h1>The Origin of Ju Jutsu / Jiu Jitsu</h1>
      <p><q>As to the origin and native land of Ju Jutsu, there are several opinions, but they are found to be mere assumptions based on narratives relating to the founding of certain schools, or some incidental records or illustrations found in the ancient manuscripts not only in Japan but in China, Persia, Germany, and Egypt. There is no record by which the origins of Ju Jutsu can be definitely established. It would, however, be rational to assume that ever since the creation, with the instinct of self-preservation, man has had to fight for existence, and was inspired to develop an art or skill to implement the body mechanism for this purpose. In such efforts, the development may have taken various courses according to the condition of life or tribal circumstance, but the object and mechanics of the body being common, the results could not have been so very different from each other. No doubt this is the reason for finding records relating to the practice of arts similar to Ju Jutsu in various parts of the world, and also for the lack of records of its origins.</q>

      <span class="titles"><h1>Jiu Jitsu</h1></span>
      <hr>
      <p>Jujutsu, also known in the West as ju-jitsu or jiu-jitsu, is a Japanese martial art and a method of close
        combat for defeating an armed and armored opponent in which one uses either a short weapon or none.
        "Jū" can be translated to mean "gentle, soft, supple, flexible, pliable, or yielding." "Jutsu" can be translated
        to mean "art" or "technique" and represents manipulating the opponent's force against himself rather than confronting
        it with one's own force. Jujutsu developed to combat the samurai of feudal Japan as a method for defeating an armed
        and armored opponent in which one uses no weapon, or only a short weapon. Because striking against an armored opponent
        proved ineffective, practitioners learned that the most efficient methods for neutralizing an enemy took the form of
        pins, joint locks, and throws. These techniques were developed around the principle of using an attacker's energy against
        him, rather than directly opposing it.
        There are many variations of the art, which leads to a diversity of approaches. Jujutsu schools (ryū) may
        utilize all forms of grappling techniques to some degree (i.e. throwing, trapping, joint locks, holds, gouging,
        biting, disengagements, striking, and kicking). In addition to jujutsu, many schools teach the use of weapons.
        Today, jujutsu is practiced in both traditional and modern sports forms. Derived sport forms include the Olympic sport
        and martial art of judo, which was developed by Kanō Jigorō in the late 19th century from several traditional styles of jujutsu,
        and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which was derived from earlier (pre–World War II) versions of Kodokan judo.</p>
      <br />

      <span class="titles"><h1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h1></span>
      <hr>
      <p>Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling and
        especially ground fighting. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was formed from Kodokan judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals that were taught
        by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake. Brazilian jiu-jitsu eventually came to be its
        own combat sport through the experiments, practices, and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Hélio Gracie (who passed their knowledge
        on to their extended family) as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda, such as Luiz França.
        BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves or another against a bigger, stronger, heavier
        assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint locks and
        chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations. Sparring
        (commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed
        on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.
        Since its inception in 1882, its parent art of judo was separated from older systems of Japanese jujutsu by an important difference that
        was passed on to Brazilian jiu-jujitsu. It is not solely a martial art; it is also a sport, a method for promoting physical fitness and
        building character in young people, and ultimately a way of life.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Kanō Jigorō (嘉納 治五郎, 28 October 1860 – 5 May 1938) was a Japanese educator and athlete, the founder of Judo. Judo was the first Japanese martial art to gain widespread international recognition, and the first to become an official Olympic sport. Pedagogical innovations attributed to Kanō include the use of black and white belts, and the introduction of dan ranking to show the relative ranking among members of a martial art style. Well-known mottoes attributed to Kanō include "Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort" （精力善用 Sei-ryoku Zen-yō）and "Mutual Welfare and Benefit"（自他共栄 Ji-ta Kyō-ei）.
      In his professional life, Kanō was an educator. Important postings included serving as director of primary education for the Ministry of Education (文部省 Monbushō) from 1898 to 1901, and as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School from 1901 until 1920. He played a key role in making judo and kendo part of the Japanese public school programs of the 1910s.</p>
      <p>Kanō was also a pioneer of international sports. Accomplishments included being the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (he served from 1909 until 1938); officially representing Japan at most Olympic Games held between 1912 and 1936; and serving as a leading spokesman for Japan's bid for the 1940 Olympic Games.
      His official honors and decorations included the First Order of Merit and Grand Order of the Rising Sun and the Third Imperial Degree. Kanō was inducted as the first member of the International Judo Federation (IJF) Hall of Fame on 14 May 1999.</p>

      <span class="titles"><h2>Carlos Gracie</h2></span>
      <hr>
      <p>Carlos Gracie (September 14, 1902 – October 7, 1994) was a Brazilian martial artist who is credited with being one of the primary developers of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Along with his younger brother Hélio Gracie and fellow students Luis Franca and Oswaldo Fadda, He helped develop Brazilian jiu-jitsu based on knowledge from Mitsuyo Maeda, and is widely considered to be the martial-arts patriarch of the Gracie family. He acquired his knowledge of Jiu-Jitsu by studying in Belém under Maeda and his students. As he taught the techniques to his brothers, he created a martial arts family with Hélio and with other members of the Gracie family who provided key contributions to the style.</p>
      <p>Carlos was born in Belém in 1902, the first of eight children. He was a mischievous, aggressive child, prone to getting involved in brawls and getting expelled from schools. When Carlos was 15 years old, hoping find a way for him to vent his aggression, his father Gastao took him to a professional wrestling challenge hosted in the circus he owned, where Carlos witnessed how the judoka Mitsuyo Maeda defeated a much bigger man. Impressed by the feat, he started training under Maeda and his assistant Jacyntho Ferro, albeit for a short time, as his family moved to Rio de Janeiro for economic reasons. There Gracie started working as a bouncer in his father's casino until a falling out among them, and after some other jobs he became a pupil of Donato Pires dos Reis, a police hand-to-hand instructor and apprentice to Maeda. Under him, Carlos had his first formal training, learning especially self-defense-oriented techniques.</p>

      <span class="titles"><h2>Mitsuyo Maeda</h2></span>
      <hr>
      <p>Mitsuyo Maeda (前田 光世 Maeda Mitsuyo, born November 18, 1878  – November 28, 1941), a Brazilian naturalized as Otávio Maeda (Portuguese pronunciation: [oˈtavju mɐˈedɐ]), was a Japanese judōka (judo expert) and prizefighter in no holds barred competitions. He was also known as Count Combat or Conde Koma in Spanish and Portuguese, a nickname he picked up in Spain in 1908. Along with Antônio Soshihiro Satake (another naturalized Brazilian), he pioneered judo in Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Maeda was fundamental to the development of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, including through his teaching of Carlos Gracie and others of the Gracie family. He was also a promoter of Japanese emigration to Brazil. Maeda won more than 2,000 professional fights in his career. His accomplishments led to him being called the "toughest man who ever lived" and being referred to as the father of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.</p>
      <p>Maeda was born in Funazawa Village, Hirosaki City, Aomori Prefecture, Japan, on November 18, 1878. He attended Kenritsu Itiu high school (currently Hirokou—a Hirosaki school). As a child, he was known as Hideyo. He practiced sumo as a teenager, but lacked the ideal build for the sport. Because of the interest generated by stories about the success of judo at contests against jujutsu that were occurring at the time, he changed from sumo to judo. In 1894, at seventeen years of age, his parents sent him to Tokyo to enroll in Waseda University. He joined Kodokan the following year.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Hélio Gracie (Portuguese: [ˈɛlju ˈɡɾejsi]; October 1, 1913 – January 29, 2009) was a Brazilian martial artist who, together with his brother Carlos Gracie, founded the martial art of Gracie jiu-jitsu, also known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. According to Rorion Gracie, his father Hélio is one of the first sports heroes in Brazilian history; he was named Man of the Year in 1997 by the American martial arts publication Black Belt magazine. A patriarch of the Gracie family, he was the father of Rickson, Royler, Royce, Relson, and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) co-founder Rorion Gracie, among other sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>When he was 16 years old, he found the opportunity to teach a judo class and this experience led him to develop Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. A director of the Bank of Brazil, Mario Brandt, arrived for a private class at the original Gracie Academy in Rio de Janeiro, as scheduled. The instructor, Carlos Gracie, was running late and was not present. Helio offered to begin the class with the man. When the tardy Carlos arrived offering his apologies, the student assured him it was no problem, and actually requested that he be allowed to continue learning with Helio Gracie instead. Carlos agreed to this and Helio Gracie became an instructor.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Oswaldo Baptista Fadda (January 15, 1921 – April 1, 2005) was a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, reaching the rank of "nono grau", a ninth grade red belt.[2] He is known for being one of the highest ranked non-Gracie black belts and also for teaching students from the poorer areas of Rio de Janeiro, where jiu-jitsu was regarded as an upper-class sport. Fadda's lineage, the most prominent second to the Carlos Gracie lineage, still survives through his links with today's teams such as Nova União, Grappling Fight Team,[3] as well as Deo Jiu-Jitsu (Deoclecio Paulo) and Equipe Mestre Wilson Jiu-Jitsu (Wilson Pereira Mattos).</p>
      <p>Fadda was born in Bento Ribeiro, a suburb in the north of Rio de Janeiro to a family of Italian immigrants from Sardinia. At the age of seventeen, while in the Brazilian Marines, he began to study jiu jitsu under Luiz França, a black belt under Mitsuyo Maeda. Maeda was an expert judōka with direct lineage to the founder of judo, Kanō Jigorō, who had travelled around the world as a prize fighter while also teaching the locals his self-defence techniques. After settling in Belém in 1917, Maeda had continued to teach jiu jitsu to a select group of students (including França and Carlos Gracie).</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Carlson Gracie (August 13, 1932 – February 1, 2006)[1][2] was a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. A member of the Gracie family, he was the eldest son of Carlos Gracie, and nephew to Hélio Gracie, founders of the Gracie jiu-jitsu. Carlson was an early pioneer in mixed martial arts, founding one the most successful teams of the era, which spawned many champions. In 2000, following a financial dispute, many of Carlson Gracie's students would split from him to form another MMA team, the Brazilian Top Team. </p>
      <p>Carlson fought a total of eighteen vale tudo fights, with only one loss to Luta Livre fighter Euclides Pereira in a fight that was held in Bahia.[4] His first fight was in March 17, 1953 against capoeira practitioner Luiz "Cirandinha" Aguiar, apprentice of Mestre Sinhozinho. Carlson won by submission due to mounted strikes after over an hour of fighting. His second match was a draw against another capoeirista, Wilson "Passarito" Oliveira, in May 1953. Carlson had a rematch with Passarito in March 1954 in the longest fight of his career, which he won in the fifth 30 minute round. Most notable are his four matches with Valdemar Santana, who had defeated his uncle Hélio Gracie in a fabled match in May 1955. He beat Santana in the first fight avenging his family. In October 1955 Carlson fought Santana to a draw in a jiu-jitsu match. In 1956 and 1957 Carlson won two fights and in 1959 they fought to a draw.</p>
