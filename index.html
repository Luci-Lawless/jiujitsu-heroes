      <h1>The Origin of Ju Jutsu / Jiu Jitsu</h1>
      <p><q>As to the origin and native land of Ju Jutsu, there are several opinions, but they are found to be mere assumptions based on narratives relating to the founding of certain schools, or some incidental records or illustrations found in the ancient manuscripts not only in Japan but in China, Persia, Germany, and Egypt. There is no record by which the origins of Ju Jutsu can be definitely established. It would, however, be rational to assume that ever since the creation, with the instinct of self-preservation, man has had to fight for existence, and was inspired to develop an art or skill to implement the body mechanism for this purpose. In such efforts, the development may have taken various courses according to the condition of life or tribal circumstance, but the object and mechanics of the body being common, the results could not have been so very different from each other. No doubt this is the reason for finding records relating to the practice of arts similar to Ju Jutsu in various parts of the world, and also for the lack of records of its origins.</q>
      -Sensei G. Koizumi, Kodokan 7th Dan</p>

      <span class="titles"><h1>Jiu Jitsu</h1></span>
      <hr>
      <p>Jujutsu, also known in the West as ju-jitsu or jiu-jitsu, is a Japanese martial art and a method of close
        combat for defeating an armed and armored opponent in which one uses either a short weapon or none.
        "Jū" can be translated to mean "gentle, soft, supple, flexible, pliable, or yielding." "Jutsu" can be translated
        to mean "art" or "technique" and represents manipulating the opponent's force against himself rather than confronting
        it with one's own force. Jujutsu developed to combat the samurai of feudal Japan as a method for defeating an armed
        and armored opponent in which one uses no weapon, or only a short weapon. Because striking against an armored opponent
        proved ineffective, practitioners learned that the most efficient methods for neutralizing an enemy took the form of
        pins, joint locks, and throws. These techniques were developed around the principle of using an attacker's energy against
        him, rather than directly opposing it.
        There are many variations of the art, which leads to a diversity of approaches. Jujutsu schools (ryū) may
        utilize all forms of grappling techniques to some degree (i.e. throwing, trapping, joint locks, holds, gouging,
        biting, disengagements, striking, and kicking). In addition to jujutsu, many schools teach the use of weapons.
        Today, jujutsu is practiced in both traditional and modern sports forms. Derived sport forms include the Olympic sport
        and martial art of judo, which was developed by Kanō Jigorō in the late 19th century from several traditional styles of jujutsu,
        and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which was derived from earlier (pre–World War II) versions of Kodokan judo.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span class="titles"><h1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h1></span>
      <hr>
      <p>Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a martial art and combat sport system that focuses on grappling and
        especially ground fighting. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was formed from Kodokan judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals that were taught
        by a number of individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake. Brazilian jiu-jitsu eventually came to be its
        own combat sport through the experiments, practices, and adaptation of judo through Carlos and Hélio Gracie (who passed their knowledge
        on to their extended family) as well as other instructors who were students of Maeda, such as Luiz França.
        BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves or another against a bigger, stronger, heavier
        assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint locks and
        chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations. Sparring
        (commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training, and a premium is placed
        on performance, especially in competition, in relation to progress and ascension through its ranking system.
        Since its inception in 1882, its parent art of judo was separated from older systems of Japanese jujutsu by an important difference that
        was passed on to Brazilian jiu-jujitsu. It is not solely a martial art; it is also a sport, a method for promoting physical fitness and
        building character in young people, and ultimately a way of life.</p>

      <hr>
      Kanō Jigorō (嘉納 治五郎, 28 October 1860 – 5 May 1938) was a Japanese educator and athlete, the founder of Judo. Judo was the first Japanese martial art to gain widespread international recognition, and the first to become an official Olympic sport. Pedagogical innovations attributed to Kanō include the use of black and white belts, and the introduction of dan ranking to show the relative ranking among members of a martial art style. Well-known mottoes attributed to Kanō include "Maximum Efficiency with Minimum Effort" （精力善用 Sei-ryoku Zen-yō）and "Mutual Welfare and Benefit"（自他共栄 Ji-ta Kyō-ei）.
      In his professional life, Kanō was an educator. Important postings included serving as director of primary education for the Ministry of Education (文部省 Monbushō) from 1898 to 1901, and as president of Tokyo Higher Normal School from 1901 until 1920. He played a key role in making judo and kendo part of the Japanese public school programs of the 1910s.
      Kanō was also a pioneer of international sports. Accomplishments included being the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) (he served from 1909 until 1938); officially representing Japan at most Olympic Games held between 1912 and 1936; and serving as a leading spokesman for Japan's bid for the 1940 Olympic Games.
      His official honors and decorations included the First Order of Merit and Grand Order of the Rising Sun and the Third Imperial Degree. Kanō was inducted as the first member of the International Judo Federation (IJF) Hall of Fame on 14 May 1999.

      <hr>
      <p>Carlos Gracie (September 14, 1902 – October 7, 1994) was a Brazilian martial artist who is credited with being one of the primary developers of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Along with his younger brother Hélio Gracie and fellow students Luis Franca and Oswaldo Fadda, He helped develop Brazilian jiu-jitsu based on knowledge from Mitsuyo Maeda, and is widely considered to be the martial-arts patriarch of the Gracie family. He acquired his knowledge of Jiu-Jitsu by studying in Belém under Maeda and his students. As he taught the techniques to his brothers, he created a martial arts family with Hélio and with other members of the Gracie family who provided key contributions to the style.</p>
      <p>Carlos was born in Belém in 1902, the first of eight children. He was a mischievous, aggressive child, prone to getting involved in brawls and getting expelled from schools. When Carlos was 15 years old, hoping find a way for him to vent his aggression, his father Gastao took him to a professional wrestling challenge hosted in the circus he owned, where Carlos witnessed how the judoka Mitsuyo Maeda defeated a much bigger man. Impressed by the feat, he started training under Maeda and his assistant Jacyntho Ferro, albeit for a short time, as his family moved to Rio de Janeiro for economic reasons. There Gracie started working as a bouncer in his father's casino until a falling out among them, and after some other jobs he became a pupil of Donato Pires dos Reis, a police hand-to-hand instructor and apprentice to Maeda. Under him, Carlos had his first formal training, learning especially self-defense-oriented techniques.</p>
